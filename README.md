This project provides a deep dive into advanced Linux command-line concepts, empowering you to control how programs interact, manage running processes, and manipulate data flow.

You will explore the foundational mechanisms of standard input, output, and error streams, learn to monitor and control system processes, and master the powerful techniques of pipes and redirection to build sophisticated command pipelinesThis project provides a deep dive into advanced Linux command-line concepts, empowering you to control how programs interact, manage running processes, and manipulate data flow.
